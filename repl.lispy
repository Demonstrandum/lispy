;; REPL Implementation for LISPY

;; A REPL is easy to implement in lisps, in fact
;;   the very name REPL comes from something that
;;   can be very easily done in lisp:
;;     It stands for a READ-EVAL-PRINT-LOOP
;;
;; A REPL is implemented very naivly as such:
;   (loop (print (eval (read))))

(loop (print "=> " (repr (eval (read "[lispy]> "))) "\n"))
