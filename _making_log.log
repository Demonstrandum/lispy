	14/12/2018 - Parser logic error: onec we notice an R_PAREN ahead, we need to skip over it as to
			not let the parse re-read it and interpret is an another R_PAREN.
			This was causing the parser to read "(f (g 4) 3)" as "(f (g 4)) 3" becasue
			the first R_PAREN closed both.
	04/01/2019 - Scoping partially impl. and functions now have own scopes and are bound to scopes
			through symbol tables, bound to the AST nodes object ID.
	25/02/2019 - Everything seems to be fully functional.  All that's left is
			perhaps the continuous addition of new features and optimising the
			interpreter, perhaps even porting it to another language.
